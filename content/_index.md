## Self Q&A introduction-thingy

No blog website is complete without some kind of a self-introduction and lucky
for you it is right here on the landing page!

If you were looking for the [list of post(s) it is here](@/posts/_index.md)

Anyway, so here we go:

### Who am I?

Great question, I would like to know as well. For what I do know

I am paid to tap on the computers, it has been ride so far & I have it on good
authority that ride never ends.

So far I've had to very _professionally_ deal with these headaches:
 * *Kubernetes*, and making it do some interesting things.
 * *Bazel* to reproducibly build a lot of YAML.
 * *AWS IAM* & account management, with too many accounts than anyone needs.
 * _Cyber_ Security, mainly in the Cloud area, and some application stuff sprinkled in.
 * *Identity & Access* management with a tree of too many people
 * Shoving *Go*, *Python* and *Rust* code where it should & should not _go_.

Weirdly enough those will probably be the main topics of this place.

### What to expect?

An invariable level of writing ability that goes from stream of thoughts to
an academia report that is due tomorrow.
I won't delude any expectations that it is any good but at least I've
had some fun writing it.

### Why have a in blog in the good year of {{ current_year }}?!

It is what all the cool cats do these days and I wanted to be apart of the cool
crowd this time.

Plus, it helps to form an idea by writing it down than just thinking about it on a bus.

### What do I really want this for?

Really, my goal is to record some of my learnings so that others might be
able to share the pain, save some time or even (big _IF_ here) teach someone
something.

I am aware my main audience is myself in 5 months when I forget what I
did in my old-er age & am going through the pain again but that's not too bad IMO (you're doing great future me).

## Big Thanks You

No one can get to where they are today with help. For me, I would never
be able to make this site without these cool people, so big thanks to:
 * [zola](https://www.getzola.org) for the static site generator this here site
     is made with.
 * [RatanShreshtha/DeepThought](https://github.com/RatanShreshtha/DeepThought)
     for the very snazzy theme.
 * Might be wondering _"damn that's a cool pfp"_ that was by the great
     [@grubkiss](https://twitter.com/grubkiss)
 * [mango.pdf.zone](https://mango.pdf.zone/) or [@mangopdf](https://twitter.com/mangopdf), they have been a great inspiration in acceptable ~~memes~~ writing styles.
 * [@__steele](https://twitter.com/__steele) that has successfully started a co-woker blog race, with [complementary blog link](https://awsteele.com/)
 * And You too, for spending your time &amp; data to see, read, wish you didn't then laugh at this meta text.

## How to report a wrong

I'm a human, at least that is what the capatcha leads me to believe, therefore
I err. If there is anything you feel like that should be corrected @ me on the
socials at the top of this page and I'll do my best to correct it.
